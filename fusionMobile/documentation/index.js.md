# index.js

This file serves as the entry point for a React Native application that uses Expo. It's setting up global variables, configuring navigation, and integrating context providers for account management and onboarding.

### Contents:

- First, it imports a `globals.js` file that likely sets up global variables or polyfills.
- It then imports `registerRootComponent` from the `expo` package, which is used to bootstrap the root React component into the native app.
- React is imported, presumably for using JSX syntax and React components.
- The `Alert` component from `react-native` is imported, which is used for displaying alert dialogues.
- A WebView-based crypto polyfill `react-native-webview-crypto` is imported to provide cryptographic capabilities usually not accessible in React Native's bare environment.
- The main App component from `App.tsx` is imported along with `NavigationContainer` from a local file, which will be used to contain and manage app navigation.
- Context providers for an account and onboarding are imported suggesting they manage global states related to user accounts and onboarding processes.
- The `createBaseTables` function is imported from a local library, which is called asynchronously to set up some initial storage or database configuration.
- If there is an error during the `createBaseTables` execution, an alert is shown to notify the user.
- A functional component `MainApp` is declared which renders the necessary providers and the main `App` component.
- Finally, `registerRootComponent` is called with `MainApp` to ensure that the application is properly bootstrapped in both the Expo Go client and standalone native builds.

### Usage:

When the app is launched, this file will:

1. Set up any necessary global variables or polyfills.
2. Create base tables for the app using the `createBaseTables` function.
3. Display an error if the base table creation fails.
4. Render the main `App` component within the provided contexts and navigation container.
5. Use the `PolyfillCrypto` component to offer cryptographic functionalities for secure data manipulation.

### Considerations:

- The asynchronous self-invoking function should handle errors gracefully, possibly including retry logic or user-friendly messaging.
- Include error boundaries in the React component tree to gracefully handle any runtime errors in the application.
- Ensure that all context providers are correctly set up and handle state management consistently.
- Crypto operations can be computationally expensive, ensure they do not degrade app performance, especially on startup.
- Make sure that navigation routes and screens are correctly set up within `NavigationContainer`.

By structuring the entry point in this way, the app's global configuration, navigation, and context are centralized, allowing for cleaner management as the application scales.
