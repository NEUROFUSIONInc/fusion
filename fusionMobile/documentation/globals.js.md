# globals.js

This file is configuring global variables for the environment. Specifically, it is setting the `TextEncoder` global to be the `TextEncoder` exported from the `text-encoding` package.

```js
global.TextEncoder = require("text-encoding").TextEncoder;
```

## Usage

When this file is executed, it adds `TextEncoder` to the global scope, allowing it to be used throughout the application without needing to `require` it in every file where it's needed.

The `text-encoding` package is a polyfill that can be useful in a Node.js environment or a browser context where `TextEncoder` is not natively available. This polyfill provides an implementation consistent with the Encoding Living Standard API for encoding and decoding text.

## Considerations

- Ensure that the `text-encoding` package is installed in your project (e.g., via npm or yarn) before using this line.
- This script should be run in an initial bootstrap file or before any other script that requires `TextEncoder`.
- Overriding global variables can be risky if it alters expected behaviors in other parts of your application or dependencies. Always test thoroughly.
- Make sure to track the version of the `text-encoding` package in your dependency management system to avoid any breaking changes in future updates.
