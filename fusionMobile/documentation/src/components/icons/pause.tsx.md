The `Pause.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a pause icon using SVG. Here's a detailed explanation of its content:

- **Imports:**
  - `React`: to create the functional component.
  - `SvgProps`: TypeScript type for SVG component props from `react-native-svg`.
  - `Svg` and `Path`: Components from `react-native-svg` used to construct SVG elements.

- **Component:**
  - `Pause`: A functional component that takes several props:
    - `color`: Optional prop to set the stroke color of the pause icon, defaulting to white.
    - `width`: Optional prop to set the width of the SVG canvas, defaulting to `20`.
    - `height`: Optional prop to set the height of the SVG canvas, defaulting to `21`.
    - `props`: Spread operator is used to pass any additional props to the component.

- **Return Value:**
  - The component returns an `Svg` element with the following attributes:
    - `width` and `height` determine the size of the SVG canvas.
    - `viewBox` defines the position and dimensions in the SVG canvas user space.
    - `fill="none"` indicates that the inside of the drawn elements won't be filled, focusing solely on the strokes.

- **SVG Path:** 
  - Two `Path` components draw two vertical bars representing the pause symbol.
  - `stroke` sets the color, `strokeWidth` sets the width of the strokes, and `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` style the endpoints and joints of the stroke lines.

- **Props Spread:**
  - `{...props}` spreads any additional props across the `Svg` component, enabling further customization by passing more attributes or styles.

To utilize this component in a React Native app:

```jsx
import { Pause } from '~/components/icons';

// Inside your component's render method
<Pause color="#000" /> // Renders a black pause icon
```

By providing props like `color`, `width`, and `height`, you have the flexibility to adjust the appearance of the icon to fit various application contexts.
