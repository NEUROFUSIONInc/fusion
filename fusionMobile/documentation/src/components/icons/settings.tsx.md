The `Settings.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a settings icon using SVG. Here's a detailed analysis of the code:

- **Import Statements:**
  - `React`: Imports the `React` namespace, which provides access to React-specific features.
  - `SvgProps`: Imports the type definition for the props that can be passed to SVG components.
  - `Svg`, `Path`: Components from the `react-native-svg` library used to create SVG elements for React Native.

- **Settings Component:**
  - The `Settings` function component takes in props of type `SvgProps`, with a default `color` prop value set to `"white"`.
  - The component returns an SVG element with a `width` and `height` of `"24"`, a `viewBox` of `"0 0 24 24"`, and no fill (`fill="none"`).
  - The SVG contains multiple `Path` elements, each representing a part of the settings icon, such as the gears or cogs.
  - Each `Path` element has various attributes including the `id`, `d` (path data), `stroke` (color of the stroke), `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin`.
  - `color` is used as the stroke color, allowing customization of the icon color through the `color` prop.

- **Usage:**
  - The `Settings` component can be used in a React Native application to display a settings or gear icon, with the ability to customize its color.
  - Example usage in a component:
    ```jsx
    import { Settings } from '~/components/icons';

    const MyComponent = () => (
      <View>
        <Settings color="#000000" /> {/* Renders a black settings icon */}
      </View>
    );
    ```

This file encapsulates the SVG markup for a settings icon within a React functional component, thus making it reusable and configurable across the application.
