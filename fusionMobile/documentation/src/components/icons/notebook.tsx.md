The `Notebook.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a notebook icon using SVG. Here's a detailed explanation of its content:

- **Imports**:
  - `React`: For creating the component.
  - `SvgProps`: TypeScript type for SVG component props from `react-native-svg`.
  - `Svg` and `Path`: Components from `react-native-svg` used to construct SVG elements.

- **Component**:
  - `Notebook`: A function component receiving several props:
    - `color`: Optional prop for the stroke color of the icon; defaults to `"white"`.
    - `width`: Optional prop for the SVG canvas width; defaults to `20`.
    - `height`: Optional prop for the SVG canvas height; defaults to `21`.
    - `props`: Rest parameter that can pass any additional props to the component.

- **Return Value**:
  - The component returns an `Svg` element defined with the `width`, `height`, `viewBox`, and `fill` attributes:
    - `viewBox` specifies the position and dimension in user space on the SVG canvas.
    - The `fill="none"` indicates that the inside of the icon won't be filled, focusing only on the stroke (outline).

- **SVG Path**:
  - `Path` components are used to draw the notebook shape, consisting of:
    - A rectangle representing the cover.
    - Horizontal lines inside, depicting the lines on the pages.
    - A vertical line on the left side, symbolizing the notebook's spine.
  - The attributes `stroke`, `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` are used to style the path elements.

- **Props Spread**:
  - `{...props}` is used to spread any additional props over the `Svg` component, which allows for further customization by passing in more attributes or styles.

To use this component within a React Native application:

```jsx
import { Notebook } from '~/components/icons';

// Inside your component's render method
<Notebook color="#000" /> // This will render a black notebook icon
```

The component's props (`color`, `width`, and `height`) offer flexibility in adjusting the appearance of the icon for different contexts throughout the app.
