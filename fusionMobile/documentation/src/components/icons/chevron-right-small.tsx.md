The `chevron-right-small.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a small right-facing chevron icon. This React component utilizes the `react-native-svg` library to draw SVG elements.

Content Summary:

- This file imports React and the type `SvgProps` from `react-native-svg`.
- It includes the `Svg` and `Path` components from `react-native-svg` to create the SVG icon.
- It defines a `ChevronRightSmall` React functional component that accepts SVG properties with default color, width, and height set to "white", "12", and "13" respectively.
- Within the `ChevronRightSmall` component:
  - An `Svg` element is created with specific `width`, `height`, and `viewBox` attributes to define the visual boundaries of the SVG content.
  - A `Path` element is used to draw the chevron shape based on the path `d` attribute.
  - The `stroke` attribute specifies the color of the path, with the `color` prop setting it.
  - `strokeWidth` sets the thickness of the lines used for the chevron shape.
  - `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` are set to "round" for rounded ends on the line strokes.

Usage example in a React component:

```jsx
import { ChevronRightSmall } from 'path-to-this-icon/chevron-right-small';

// Inside a component's render method or JSX:
<ChevronRightSmall color="#000" width={12} height={13} />
```

If placed in the JSX of a React component, as shown above, this would render the `ChevronRightSmall` icon with the specified properties, allowing it to be styled and sized as needed within the user interface.
