The `users.tsx` file defines a React component named `Users` that renders a group of user icons using SVG. Below is the detailed information about the file content:

- **Import Statements:**
  - The `React` import allows using React functionalities and JSX syntax.
  - The `SvgProps` type is imported for type-checking props passed to the SVG component.
  - The `Svg` and `Path` components are imported from `react-native-svg`, which enables rendering SVGs in React Native.

- **Users Component:**
  - This is a functional component that uses the `SvgProps` for its props, allowing the passing of standard SVG properties.
  - A default value for `color` is defined as "#5E6068" (a grey shade). This default value can be overridden when the component is used.
  - The component renders an SVG element with the specified `width` and `height`, both set to 24, and a `viewBox` of "0 0 24 24", defining the viewing area of the SVG.
  - Inside the `Svg` element, there are three `Path` elements that draw different parts of the user icons:
    - The first `Path` element draws a circular head and a body for one user.
    - The second `Path` element draws the base of the group indicating more people behind the first user.
    - The third `Path` element represents additional details of the group on the left side, likely to indicate users in the background.
    - The fourth `Path` element represents additional details of the group on the right side.

- **Usage:**
  - The `Users` component can be used in any React Native application component where a group of user icons is needed.
  - It allows customization of the icon color through props when the component is used in other parts of the application.
  - Example usage:
    ```jsx
    import { Users } from '~/components/icons';

    const UserGroupIcon = () => {
      return <Users color="#000000" />;
    };
    ```

In summary, the `Users` component provides a scalable and customizable group of user icons for use throughout a React Native application, with the default appearance of a grey icon group. It utilizes the `react-native-svg` library to render SVG icons in the application.
