The `Pencil.tsx` file defines a React functional component that renders a pencil icon using SVG graphics. Here's a breakdown of its code:

- **Imports:**
  - `React` from "react": Needed to define the functional component.
  - `SvgProps` from "react-native-svg": TypeScript type for SVG props, used to type-check the component's props.
  - `Svg` and `Path` from "react-native-svg": SVG elements used to construct the pencil icon.

- **Pencil Component:**
  - A functional component that takes several props defined by the SvgProps and additional custom props such as `color`, `width`, and `height`.
  - Default values are provided for these props, setting the color to white and the dimensions to `20x21` if not specified by the user.
  - The SVG is wrapped in a `Svg` element and contains two `Path` elements that draw the pencil's shape.

- **Return Value:**
  - The component returns an SVG rendering of a pencil with customizable color and size.
  - The `viewBox` attribute defines the aspect ratio and scaling of the SVG content.
  - The `fill="none"` attribute ensures that the SVG's path is not filled with any color, allowing the defined stroke attributes to depict the pencil's outline.

- **SVG Path:**
  - The first `Path` element draws the main structure of the pencil, including the body and tip.
  - The second `Path` element represents the pencil's lead tip.
  - Both paths utilize the `stroke` prop for the line color, `strokeWidth` for line thickness, and `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` for the style of the path's line ends and joins.

- **Spread Props:**
  - `{...props}` spreads the rest of the props to the `Svg` component allowing any SVG-compatible attributes to be passed in for further customization.

This component can be used in a React Native application by importing it and then including it in a component's render logic:

```jsx
import { Pencil } from '~/components/icons';

// Inside a component's render method
<Pencil color="#000" width={24} height={24} /> // Renders a black pencil icon with the specified width and height
```

By passing in different `color`, `width`, and `height` props when using the `Pencil` component, developers have the flexibility to customize the icon's appearance to match different design requirements within the app.
