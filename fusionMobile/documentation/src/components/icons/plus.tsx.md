The `Plus.tsx` file defines a React functional component that renders a plus icon using SVG graphics. Below is a detailed explanation of its code:

- **Imports:**
  - `React`: Used to create functional components in React.
  - `SvgProps`: Type definition for props passed to an SVG component.
  - `Svg` and `Path`: Components from `react-native-svg` used to define SVG elements for rendering.

- **Plus Component:**
  - A functional component named `Plus` which takes a `color` prop with a default value of "white" and `...props` that represent any additional props passed to the component.
  - The component returns an SVG element with a fixed width and height of 24 units, and a `viewBox` of "0 0 24 24", which determines the coordinate system used by the SVG.

- **SVG Elements:**
  - Two `Path` elements within the SVG create the lines of the plus symbol:
    - The first `Path` defines a vertical line that runs from `y=5` to `y=19`, creating the vertical part of the plus sign.
    - The second `Path` defines a horizontal line that runs from `x=5` to `x=19`, creating the horizontal part of the plus sign.
  - Both `Path` elements have their stroke set to the `color` prop, a `strokeWidth` of "1.5", and use `round` as the value for both `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` to create rounded ends and joins for the lines.

- **Usage:**
  - The `Plus` component can be used in a React component to render a plus icon, with the ability to override the default color.

Example of using the `Plus` component:
```jsx
import { Plus } from '~/components/icons';

// Inside a component's render method
<Plus color="#000" /> // Renders the plus icon with a black stroke color
```

This `Plus` component is versatile and can be easily reused throughout the application, providing a consistent look and feel for plus icons.
