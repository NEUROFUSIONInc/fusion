The `vertical-menu.tsx` file defines a React component called `VerticalMenu`, which renders a vertical dot menu icon commonly used as a visual identifier for opening more options or a menu. This component is built with SVG using the `react-native-svg` library, which allows for vector graphics rendering in React Native applications. Below are more details about the file content:

### Import Statements:
- The file begins by importing React for using JSX.
- The `SvgProps` from `react-native-svg` allows type-checking for SVG component props in TypeScript.
- The `Svg` and `Circle` components are imported from `react-native-svg` to create and position circles to form the menu icon.

### VerticalMenu Component:
- `VerticalMenu` is a functional component that receives `SvgProps` with a destructuring pattern, defining the default values for `width`, `height`, and `color` if they are not provided by the parent component.
- The `width` is set to `5`, `height` to `25`, and the default color of the circles is `white`.
- The SVG element has `width`, `height`, and `viewBox` properties that define the drawable region of the component.
- Three `Circle` elements are rendered inside the `Svg` to display three evenly spaced white circles, representing a vertical menu icon.
- `cx` and `cy` represent the x and y coordinate of the center of each circle, while `r` is the radius of the circles.
- The `fill` property of the circles is set to `color`, which is destructured from the props and has a default white value.

### Usage:
The `VerticalMenu` component can be used in any React Native application where a visual indicator for more options or a menu is needed. Because of the SVG nature, it is resolution-independent and customizable via the `color` prop, among other SVG properties.

### Example Usage:
```jsx
import { VerticalMenu } from '~/components/icons';

const MyMenuButton = () => {
  return <VerticalMenu color="#000" />;
};
```

This code snippet shows how the `VerticalMenu` component can be easily integrated into an application screen, providing a customizable and scalable vertical dot menu icon.
