The `chevron-right.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a right-facing chevron icon. 

This file imports React and the `SvgProps` type from `react-native-svg`, a library for rendering SVG images in React Native.

The `ChevronRight` component is a functional component that accepts SVG properties with default colors of white, width, and height of 24.

Inside the `ChevronRight` component:

- An `Svg` component sets the width and height to 24 and defines the viewbox size.
- The `Path` component draws the actual chevron shape using the `d` attribute, which sets the path for the chevron.
- The `stroke` property controls the color of the chevron, defaulting to white but can be overridden by the `color` prop.
- `strokeWidth`, `strokeLinecap`, and `strokeLinejoin` are set to control the appearance of the stroke.

This component is reusable and can be styled via props for different use cases within a React Native application.
