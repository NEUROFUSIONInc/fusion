The `chevron-left.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a left-facing chevron icon. The ChevronLeft component leverages the `react-native-svg` library to generate SVG elements.

Content Summary:

- Import React and the `SvgProps` type from `react-native-svg`.
- Import the `Svg` and `Path` components from `react-native-svg` for SVG creation.
- Define a `ChevronLeft` functional component that accepts `SvgProps`.
- The component accepts props such as `color`, `width`, and `height`, with default options set. These props can be overwritten when the component is used.
- Inside the component, an `Svg` element is created with specified `width`, `height`, and `viewBox`. The `viewBox` attribute defines the canvas size for the SVG.
- The `fill` attribute is set to `"none"` indicating no fill color for the SVG.
- A `Path` element is drawn with attributes to describe the shape of a left-pointing chevron:
   - `d` describes the path to be drawn.
   - `stroke` sets the color of the chevron lines.
   - `strokeWidth` sets the thickness of the stroke, in this case, `1.5`.
   - `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` are both set to `"round"` for rounded ends on the stroke.

Usage Example:

```jsx
import { ChevronLeft } from './path-to-icons-folder/chevron-left';

// In a component render method:
<ChevronLeft color="#000" width={24} height={24} />
```

In the usage example, the `ChevronLeft` component is used with a black stroke color and with a size of 24x24 pixels. The `color`, `width`, and `height` can be customized when the component is declared.
