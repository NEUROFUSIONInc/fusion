The `chart-arcs.tsx` file contains a React component that renders an SVG representation of a set of chart arcs or circles. This component is likely used to display a circular chart or a portion of it, commonly in dashboards, analytics sections, or any part of an application where visual data representation is needed. The component can be customized by providing a `color` prop to change the color of the arcs.

Content Breakdown:
- React is imported along with the `SvgProps` type from `react-native-svg` for type checking.
- The `Svg` and `Path` components from `react-native-svg` are imported to create the SVG elements.
- A `ChartArcs` functional component is defined that takes `SvgProps` as its prop. This allows the passing of properties like `color`, `width`, `height`, etc.
- The component has a default `color` prop set to `#5E6068`, which can be overridden by providing a different color.

Inside the component:
- An SVG is defined with a `width` and `height` of `24`, and a `viewBox` set to `0 0 24 24`, which sets the aspect ratio and size for the entire SVG.
- Three `Path` elements are created within the SVG element, each with a unique `d` prop that defines the d attribute of the path in the SVG to draw the arcs.
- These paths have `stroke` set to the `color` prop passed to the component, making it customizable.
- `strokeWidth` is set to `1.5`, which denotes the thickness of the lines for the arcs.
- `strokeLinecap` and `strokeLinejoin` properties are set to `round` for rounded corners at the endpoints and wherever paths join.

You can include this component in your React Native application as follows:

```jsx
import { ChartArcs } from './path-to-icons-folder/chart-arcs';

// In your functional component
<ChartArcs color="#FF0000" /> // This renders the chart arcs with red color
```
