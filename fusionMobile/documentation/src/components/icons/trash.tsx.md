The `trash.tsx` file defines a React component named `Trash` that renders a trash icon using SVG. Below is the detailed information about the file content:

- **Import Statements:**
  - The `React` import allows using React functionalities and JSX syntax.
  - The `SvgProps` type is imported for type-checking props passed to the SVG component.
  - The `Svg` and `Path` components are imported from `react-native-svg`, which enables rendering SVGs in React Native.

- **Trash Component:**
  - This component is a functional component that uses the `SvgProps` for its props, allowing the passing of standard SVG properties.
  - A default value for `color` is defined as "white" and default values for `width` and `height` are set as 20 and 21, respectively. These default values can be overridden when the component is used.
  - The component renders an SVG element with the specified `width`, `height`, and `viewBox`. The `viewBox` is set to "0 0 20 21", which defines the viewing area of the SVG.
  - Inside the `Svg` element, there are multiple `Path` elements that draw the icon's shapes:
    - The first `Path` element represents the top bar of the trash bin.
    - The next two `Path` elements resemble the handles/side bars inside the trash bin.
    - The fourth `Path` element outlines the body of the trash bin, including the main container and lid.
    - The last `Path` element defines the top section of the trash bin, possibly representing a lid opening.

- **Usage:**
  - The `Trash` component can be used in any React Native application component where a trash icon is needed.
  - It allows customization of the icon's color, width, and height through props when the component is used in other parts of the application.
  - Example usage:
    ```jsx
    import { Trash } from '~/components/icons';

    const MyDeleteButton = () => {
      return <Trash color="#000000" width={18} height={18} />;
    };
    ```
  
In summary, the `Trash` component provides a scalable and customizable trash bin icon for use throughout a React Native application, with the default appearance of a white icon. It utilizes the `react-native-svg` library to render SVG icons in the application.
