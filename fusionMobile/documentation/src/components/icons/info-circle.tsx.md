The `InfoCircle.tsx` file defines a React component for rendering an information circle icon using SVG. Below is an explanation of the file's contents:

- **Imports**:
  - `React`: For creating the component.
  - `SvgProps`: TypeScript type from `react-native-svg` to type the component's props.
  - `Svg` and `Path`: React components from `react-native-svg` used to draw SVG elements.

- **Component**:
  - `InfoCircle`: It's a function component that accepts several props:
    - `color`: (optional) The color of the icon, with a default value of `"#FFFFFF"` (white).
    - `width`: (optional) The width of the icon, with a default value of `24`.
    - `height`: (optional) The height of the icon, with a default value of `24`.
    - `props`: Remaining props passed to the component.

- **Return Value**:
  - The component returns an `Svg` element with the width, height, and viewBox attributes.
    - `width` and `height` determine the size of the icon.
    - `viewBox` sets the coordinate system for the shapes within the SVG.
  
- **SVG Paths**:
  - Three `Path` components are used to draw the icon's shape:
    - The first path draws a circle that represents the outer boundary of the information icon.
    - The second path represents the dot above the informational "i" character.
    - The third path creates the vertical line of the informational "i" character.

- **Props Spread**:
  - `{...props}` is used to pass any additional props to the root `Svg` component, allowing for further customization such as external styling or additional attributes.

The `InfoCircle` component can be used in a React Native application like this:
```jsx
import { InfoCircle } from '~/components/icons';

// In a component's render method
<InfoCircle color="#000000" /> // Render the icon with a black color
```

The `width`, `height`, and `color` props are customizable, enabling the icon to fit different design requirements.
