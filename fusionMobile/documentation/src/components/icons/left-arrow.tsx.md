The `LeftArrow.tsx` file defines a React component that renders a left-pointing arrow icon using Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG). Below is an explanation of the file's contents:

- **Imports**:
  - `React`: For creating the component.
  - `SvgProps`: TypeScript type from `react-native-svg` to type the component's props.
  - `Svg` and `Path`: React components from `react-native-svg` used to draw SVG elements.

- **Component**:
  - `LeftArrow`: It's a function component that takes in several props:
    - `color`: (optional) The stroke color of the arrow, defaults to `"#FFFFFF"` (white).
    - `width`: (optional) The width of the SVG canvas, defaults to `24`.
    - `height`: (optional) The height of the SVG canvas, defaults to `25`.
    - `props`: Additional props passed to the component.

- **Return Value**:
  - The component returns an `Svg` element which has the `width`, `height`, `viewBox`, and `fill` attributes set.
    - `width` and `height` determine the size of the icon within the view.
    - `viewBox` defines the position and dimension in user space which should be mapped to the `width` and `height` of the viewport.
    - `fill="none"` ensures that the shapes within the SVG are not filled with any color.

- **SVG Paths**:
  - Three `Path` components draw the different segments of the left arrow:
    - The first path creates the horizontal line of the arrow.
    - The second path draws the arrowhead's upper line segment.
    - The third path draws the arrowhead's lower line segment.

- **Props Spread**:
  - `{...props}` spreads any additional passed props to the `Svg` component, allowing for further customization such as external styling or additional attributes.

The `LeftArrow` component can be included in a React Native application using JSX like so:
```jsx
import { LeftArrow } from '~/components/icons';

// Inside a component's render function:
<LeftArrow color="#000000" /> // Renders the left arrow icon with a black color
```

The `color`, `width`, and `height` props allow for adjusting the icon to suit various application styles and needs.
