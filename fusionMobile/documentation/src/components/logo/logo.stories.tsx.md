The `src/components/logo/logo.stories.tsx` file is part of a documentation system for React components called Storybook. It helps developers visualize the different states of UI components and write documentation alongside the code.

### Content of `src/components/logo/logo.stories.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react-native";

import { Logo } from "./logo";

const meta: Meta<typeof Logo> = {
  title: "ui/Logo",
  component: Logo,
};

export default meta;

type Story = StoryObj<typeof Logo>;

export const Primary: Story = {};
```

### Explanation:

- **Imports:**
  - `Meta` and `StoryObj` types from `@storybook/react-native` are imported to define the structure and types for the story metadata and stories, respectively.
  - The `Logo` component from the current directory's `logo` file is imported for inclusion in the story.

- **Story Metadata (`meta`):**
  - A constant `meta` is defined with the type `Meta`, tailored for the `Logo` component.
  - The `title` property categorizes the story within the "ui/Logo" section in the Storybook interface.
  - The `component` property references the `Logo` component itself, which is the subject of this particular story set.

- **Default Export:**
  - The `meta` object is exported as the default export from the file. This defines the metadata that Storybook uses to configure the story.

- **Story Type Definition:**
  - A type alias `Story` is created using the `StoryObj` generic type, indicating the `Logo` component's type will be used to define individual stories.

- **Primary Story:**
  - An export `Primary` is defined with the type `Story`. In this case, it's an empty object, implying that it is a use case with default props. This will be displayed as an example of the `Logo` component in the Storybook.

### Use Case:

Developers implement stories for components to visually document various prop configurations and states. This file, in particular, sets up a template for such stories for the `Logo` component. As there are no arguments, the `Primary` story displays the component with its default props. The Storybook entries can be viewed during development and serve as live documentation for other developers or designers.
