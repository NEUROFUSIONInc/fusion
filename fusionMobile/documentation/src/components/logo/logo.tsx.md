The `src/components/logo/logo.tsx` file contains the definition of the `Logo` component used in the React Native application.

### Content of `src/components/logo/logo.tsx`:

```tsx
import React from "react";
import { Image, View, Text } from "react-native";

export const Logo = () => {
  return (
    <View
      style={{
        display: "flex",
        flexDirection: "row",
        justifyContent: "space-between",
      }}
    >
      <Image
        source={require("../../../assets/icon.png")}
        style={{ width: 35, height: 35 }}
      />
      <Text style={{ fontSize: 25, marginLeft: 10, fontWeight: "700" }}>
        FUSION
      </Text>
    </View>
  );
};
```

### Explanation:

- **Imports:**
  - The `React` object is imported for React component creation.
  - `Image`, `View`, and `Text` components from `react-native` are imported to build the UI layout.

- **Logo Component:**
  - The `Logo` is a React functional component that renders a logo for the application.
  - The `View` component is used as a container with a flexbox layout, arranged in a row, with items spaced between each other.
  - Inside the `View`, an `Image` component displays an icon from the `assets` directory, with both width and height set to 35 units.
  - Accompanied by a `Text` component which displays the text "FUSION" styled with a font size of 25, a margin to the left of 10 units, and a font weight of "700" (bold).

- **Export:**
  - The `Logo` component is exported, which can be utilized in other parts of the application where the logo is required, like headers or splash screens.

### Usage:

To include the `Logo` in any component, you can import and embed it as follows:

```jsx
import { Logo } from "./path-to-logo/logo";

// In your component's render function
<Logo />
```
This will display the logo image followed by the "FUSION" text in a row layout, which makes up the application's visual brand identity.
