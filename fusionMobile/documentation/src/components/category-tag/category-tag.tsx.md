# src/components/category-tag/category-tag.tsx

This TypeScript React Native component file defines the `CategoryTag` component, which is likely a specialized UI element used in the application to display categories with an optional tag to indicate if it is active or not. The component uses the `class-variance-authority` library for styling, indicating the usage of Tailwind CSS classes or a similar utility-first CSS system.

## Overview

The `CategoryTag` component is a flexible and customizable tag component. It allows for different styles when the tag is active and handles both click events and changes in the activity state through props.

## Content Breakdown

- **`tagStyles`**: A variable using the `cva` function to define a collection of class styles for the base appearance of the tag. This includes styles for an inactive state, such as a default border and background, padding, and active state opacity. An active variant is also defined that changes the border and background color.
  
- **`tagTextStyles`**: Another styled variable for the text within the tag, including a default and active state color.
  
- **`CategoryTagProps` Type**: A TypeScript type which extends `PressableProps` with the `VariantProps` of the `tagStyles`, adding properties specific to the `CategoryTag` component like `isActive`, `title`, `icon`, and `handleValueChange`.

- **`CategoryTag` Component**: A functional React component that:
  - Destructures and uses the properties from `CategoryTagProps`.
  - Manages its own 'active' state, controlled via the `isActive` prop and internal component state.
  - Defines an `onValueChange` function that toggles the 'active' state and calls the `handleValueChange` callback with the new state.
  - Listens for changes in the `isActive` prop and adjusts the component's state accordingly, using `useEffect`.
  - Renders a `Pressable` component and applies the styles accordingly.
  - Optionally renders an icon and the title text inside the `Pressable`.

## Usage

This component can be used to create interactive tags for categories within the application. Users can activate or deactivate the tags, and the component visually responds to these interactions.

## Considerations

- The component is both autonomous (it controls its own state) and controlled (it accepts an `isActive` prop to dictate its state). As per React best practices, it should preferably follow either controlled or uncontrolled patterns, not both.
- It accepts `PressableProps`, making it versatile for use with additional native button properties, allowing for further customization.
- By leveraging Tailwind CSS classes (or similar), the component maintains a consistent design system aligned with the rest of the application.

In summary, `CategoryTag.tsx` defines a styled tag component meant to handle user interaction and reflect a toggled state visually. It is well-equipped for scalable use within an application that categorizes data or content.
