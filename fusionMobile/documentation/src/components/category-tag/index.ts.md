# src/components/category-tag/index.ts

This TypeScript module file is responsible for exporting the `CategoryTag` component defined in the adjacent `category-tag.tsx` file.

## Content Breakdown

The file contains a single line of code:

```typescript
export * from "./category-tag";
```

This line simply re-exports everything from the `category-tag.tsx` file. In this case, it means that it's exporting the `CategoryTag` component along with any associated types such as `CategoryTagProps`.

## Usage

The purpose of this index file is to streamline the import path for the `CategoryTag` component elsewhere in the application. Instead of importing the component with a longer relative path that includes the filename, other modules can now import it more succinctly, like so:

```typescript
import { CategoryTag } from "~/components/category-tag";
```

The tilde (`~`) is typically used as an alias for the root `src` directory in many project configurations, making imports cleaner and more maintainable.

## Considerations

- The use of such index files is common in React projects, allowing for cleaner imports and the grouping of related exports.
- It also allows for future scalability by enabling the addition of more exports in this directory without changing import paths in the consuming modules.

In summary, `index.ts` provides a convenient aggregation point for all exports from the `category-tag` directory, making the `CategoryTag` component easily available for use across the application.
