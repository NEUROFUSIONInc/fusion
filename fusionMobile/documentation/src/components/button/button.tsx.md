# src/components/button/button.tsx

This TypeScript file defines the Button component, which includes various styles and states to be rendered in a React Native environment.

## Overview

The Button component utilizes the `class-variance-authority` (`cva`) library to manage different visual variants and styles. The `Button` is a flexible component that can be customized with different colors, sizes, rounded corners, and the capacity to be full-width. Additional features like 'leftIcon' and 'rightIcon' provide the ability to render icons on either side of the button text. The 'loading' state toggles an `ActivityIndicator` instead of the button text.

## Content

### Import Statements

- `cva` and `VariantProps` from `class-variance-authority` library are imported for handling CSS-in-JS patterns.
- `FC` (Functional Component) from React is imported to define the component type.
- React Native components `Pressable`, `Text`, `TouchableOpacityProps`, and `View` are imported for creating UI elements.
- The `ActivityIndicator` component is imported to be displayed when the `loading` prop is `true`.

### Button Styles

`buttonStyles` and `buttonTextStyles` are defined using the `cva` utility to handle various states and variants of the button, such as `primary`, `secondary`, `outline`, etc.

### ButtonProps Interface

The `ButtonProps` interface extends the `TouchableOpacityProps` from React Native and includes several custom props like `variant`, `disabled`, `rounded`, and others to control the appearance of the button. `title`, `leftIcon`, `rightIcon`, `loading`, and `textColor` props provide content and loading state management.

### Button Component

The `Button` component is a functional component that renders a `Pressable` UI element with conditionally rendered content based on the provided props. It applies styles based on the button's variant, size, etc., and handles the rendering of text, icons, and the activity indicator for loading states.

```jsx
export const Button: FC<ButtonProps> = ({
  // Prop deconstruction
  ...props
}) => (
  // Pressable component composition
);
```

## Usage

The `Button` component may be used in various parts of the application needing a button element, allowing for easy reuse and consistent styling across the app.

## Considerations

- Variants and custom props make the button component highly reusable and customizable.
- Conditional rendering optimizes what's on-screen based on the component state.
- This component showcases good separation of concerns, with styling abstracted away from the component logic, ensuring better maintainability. 

This file offers a concise yet flexible approach to button styling in a React Native application, allowing developers to streamline their UI development process.
