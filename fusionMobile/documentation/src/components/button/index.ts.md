# src/components/button/index.ts

This is an index file for the button component module in a React Native application that exports everything from the `button.tsx` file. It acts as a public interface for the module, making it easier to import the `Button` component elsewhere in the application.

## Overview

The purpose of an index file in a module directory is to simplify import statements elsewhere in the application by allowing components to be imported directly from the directory rather than specifying the specific file.

## Content

The file contains a single export statement:

```tsx
export * from "./button";
```

This statement uses the `export * from` syntax to re-export all exports from the `./button` file, which is the `button.tsx` file located in the same directory as the index file.

## Usage

With this index file, instead of importing the `Button` component using:

```javascript
import { Button } from "./button/button";
```

You can use a shortened version:

```javascript
import { Button } from "./button";
```

This is possible because the index file re-exports everything from `button.tsx`, and module resolution in JavaScript and TypeScript will automatically resolve the import to the index file when given a directory path.

## Considerations

- Using an index file is a common pattern in JavaScript and TypeScript applications as it streamlines import statements and module management.
- It makes refactoring easier, as the internal structure of the module can change without affecting how other parts of the application import its exports.
- When using this pattern, it's essential to be cautious about namespace collisions. Since all exports from `button.tsx` are re-exported, any conflicts with names would need to be resolved in the importing files.

This index file provides an efficient way to organize module exports and maintain cleaner import statements throughout the application.
