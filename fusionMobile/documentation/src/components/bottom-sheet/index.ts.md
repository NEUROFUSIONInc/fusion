# src/components/bottom-sheet/index.ts

This TypeScript file serves as an index for the bottom sheet component directory to simplify the import statements in other parts of the React Native application.

## Content

```typescript
export * from "./bottom-sheet";
```

The file has a single export statement that re-exports everything (`*`) from the `./bottom-sheet` file located in the same directory.

## Usage

The index file allows you to import the `BottomSheet` component and related types from `src/components/bottom-sheet` directory without needing to reference specific filenames in the import statements. This helps keep import paths cleaner and shorter.

Example usage:

```javascript
import { BottomSheet, IBottomSheetProps } from '~/components/bottom-sheet';
```

This import statement will bring in the `BottomSheet` component and the `IBottomSheetProps` interface that would be exported from `./bottom-sheet`.

## Considerations

- This index file is a common pattern in organizing projects with multiple components. It simplifies maintaining and updating import paths when files are moved or renamed.
- The decision to use such index files depends on your project structure preferences and could be helpful in a large codebase with many components.
