The `src/components/index.ts` file is a central export file for React components within the `src/components/` directory. It re-exports components from individual files, allowing other parts of the application to import these components from a single location instead of specifying individual paths for each component. This can help to keep import statements organised and concise.

### Content of `src/components/index.ts`:
The file export components from their respective files to be accessible for use in different parts of the application. Below are the components re-exported:

- `Button`: A button component for user interaction.
- `Tag`: A component that might be used for displaying tags, categories, or labels.
- `DayChip`: Possibly a component used for representing days or dates in a chip or badge style.
- `Select`: Likely a dropdown or selection component for picking from a list of options.
- `TimePicker`: A component that allows users to select a specific time.
- `Option`: Potentially a component representing a single option within a select or dropdown component.
- `Icons`: Exporting of various icon components, such as `Bulb`, `Home`, `HeartHandShake`, etc.
- `Screen`: This could be a layout or container component for different screens in the app.
- `Prompts`: This might refer to components that handle user prompts or alerts within the app.
- `BottomSheet`: A component for displaying a bottom sheet, sliding up from the bottom of the screen.
- `Input`: Likely input components such as text fields for user data entry.
- `CategoryTag`: Could be a variation of tag components, possibly used for categorisation purposes.
- `Charts`: Components that render various types of charts like bar charts and line charts.
- `ResponseTextItem`: This might be a component that shows text responses, possibly in a chat or form.
- `Subscription`: This component might be related to handling user subscriptions or membership plans.
- `ChatBubble`: Likely a UI component for showing a chat interface or message bubbles.
- `Headers`: Various header components like `ChatHeader` and `AccountHeader` for different views or sections.

### Example Usage:
```jsx
import { Button, Select, Icons, DayChip } from '~/components';

const MyComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button title="Click me" />
      <Select options={['Option 1', 'Option 2']} />
      <DayChip day="Monday" isChecked />
      <Icons.Home />
    </div>
  );
};
```

In this example, a developer can import multiple components from the `components` folder using a single import statement, making the codebase cleaner and more maintainable.
