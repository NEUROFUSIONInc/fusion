# File Overview: `src/components/prompts/create-prompt-sheet/prompt-details-step.tsx`

This TypeScript file defines the `PromptDetailsStep` component, which appears to be part of a multi-step form for creating prompts within an application.

## Content and Structure:

The `PromptDetailsStep` component is a functional component that accepts several properties to manage the state and actions associated with entering the details of a prompt:

- `promptText`: The text of the prompt that the user is creating or editing.
- `setPromptText`: A function to update the `promptText`.
- `responseType`: The type of response expected for the prompt (e.g., "yesno", "text", "number", or "customOptions").
- `setResponseType`: A function to update the `responseType`.
- `customOptions`: An array of custom response options if `responseType` is "customOptions".
- `setCustomOptions`: A function to update the `customOptions` array.
- `category`: An optional category to which the prompt belongs.
- `setCategory`: An optional function to update the category.
- `isCreating`: A boolean flag indicating if the user is in the prompt creation process.

The component consists of:

- Conditionally rendered `Text` for a title when in creation mode.
- A `Select` dropdown for choosing the prompt category (if `setCategory` is provided).
- An `Input` field for entering the prompt text.
- Another `Select` dropdown for choosing the response type.
- Conditional logic to render another `Input` field for entering custom options if the `responseType` is "customOptions". It also displays tags for these custom options.
- State management using `useState` and `useCallback` hooks for `customOptionsText`.

The component uses multiple instances of reusable sub-components like `Select`, `Input`, and `Tag` to create a complex form for data entry. It leverages hooks for handling local state and updates.

The `handleCustomOptionChange` function is used to parse custom options entered by the user and separated by semicolons into an array.
 
The component styles are handled via `className` properties, which suggest the use of a utility-first CSS framework for styling.

## Reusability of the Component:

The `PromptDetailsStep` component is a self-contained unit that provides a user interface for inputting detailed information about a prompt. It is designed to fit within a larger wizard or multi-step form flow for creating prompts, which makes it a reusable module within the related context in the application. Its modular design and clear prop structure allow for easy integration and maintenance within the broader application.

## Integration:

This component is meant to be used as part of the larger prompt creation flow, which is likely managed by a parent component responsible for orchestrating the various steps. It interacts with the application state and services to submit or manipulate prompt data. The component can be further customized for various prompt-related features, making it a versatile tool within the app's feature set related to user prompts, surveys, or questionnaires.

Overall, the `PromptDetailsStep` component plays a significant role in the prompt creation process, providing necessary UI elements for data input and validation, contributing to a smooth user experience when creating new prompts in the application.
