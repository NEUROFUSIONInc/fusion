# File Overview: `src/components/prompts/create-prompt-sheet/index.ts`

This `index.ts` file acts as an entry point to consolidate and re-export components related to the prompt creation process, making them accessible throughout the application by importing from this single point.

## Content and Structure:

This `index.ts` file re-exports three components from their respective files located in the same directory:

1. `create-prompt-sheet.tsx`: This component likely represents a user interface for creating new prompts. It encapsulates the entire UX flow required for the user to enter details and create a prompt.

2. `prompt-details-step.tsx`: This component appears to be a sub-component of the prompt creation process, potentially representing a particular step in a multi-step form. It may allow users to enter specific details about the prompt they want to create.

3. `add-prompt-sheet.tsx`: It seems to encapsulate the functionality or UI elements related to adding prompts. It could be a button or link that users interact with to initiate the prompt creation process.

## Re-export Pattern:

The file uses the `export * from` pattern to re-export modules, which means that any named export from the imported module files will be exported again with the same name from this `index.ts` file. This pattern aids in simplifying imports in other parts of the application, making them shorter and more maintainable.

For instance, instead of importing components from their individual files like this:

```typescript
import { CreatePromptSheet } from "./create-prompt-sheet/create-prompt-sheet";
import { PromptDetailsStep } from "./create-prompt-sheet/prompt-details-step";
import { AddPromptSheet } from "./create-prompt-sheet/add-prompt-sheet";
```

Other modules can simply do this:

```typescript
import { CreatePromptSheet, PromptDetailsStep, AddPromptSheet } from "./create-prompt-sheet";
```

## Purpose:

Centralizing exports in an `index.ts` file is a common practice in TypeScript projects for better organization and easier import management. This approach allows developers to keep the directory structure clean and maintainable while also offering an overview of the modules provided by a directory.
