The `src/components/prompts/create-prompt-sheet/category-selection-step.tsx` file defines a React functional component named `CategorySelectionStep`. This component is likely used as a step within a multi-step prompt creation process and allows users to select a category for their prompt. 

### Overview of `CategorySelectionStep`:

- Imports `React` utilities including `Dispatch`, `FC`, and `SetStateAction`.
- Utilizes `Text` and `View` from `react-native` for rendering text and layout containers.
- Imports the `Tag` component to display selectable categories.
- Defines a `CategorySelectionStepProps` interface which specifies the expected props for the component: `selectedCategory` to indicate the currently selected category, and `setSelectedCategory` to update the selected category.
- Implements the `CategorySelectionStep` component using the imported interface.
- Renders two text elements to provide instructions for the user: a title prompting the user to select a category and additional information to guide their choice.
- Uses a `View` element styled as a row that wraps (`flex-wrap`) to display multiple categories to choose from. It maps over the `categories` imported from the project configuration and creates a `Tag` component for each one.
- Passes the `name` and `isActive` props to each `Tag`, along with an `onPress` callback that updates the `selectedCategory` state using the `setSelectedCategory` function when a tag is pressed.

### Usage:

This component is intended to be used as part of a larger prompt creation process in an application, most likely in a form or multi-step modal where users can create a new prompt by selecting a category that the prompt belongs to. The UI guides users to make a selection, and the interactive tags facilitate the selection.

The component stands as a functional and distinct piece of a prompt creation UI flow, allowing users to categorize their prompts effectively. It's a good example of breaking down complex forms into individual, manageable steps to enhance user experience.
