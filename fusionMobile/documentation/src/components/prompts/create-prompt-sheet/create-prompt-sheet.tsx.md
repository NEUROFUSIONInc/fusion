The `src/components/prompts/create-prompt-sheet/create-prompt-sheet.tsx` file in the project defines a React functional component named `CreatePromptSheet`. This component is designed to display a modal or popover using a bottom sheet interface, facilitating users to create a new prompt with different configurations.

### Overview of `CreatePromptSheet`:

- Imports necessary React hooks (`useEffect`, `useMemo`, `useState`), high-level navigation (`useNavigation`), etc.
- Imports `BottomSheet`, `Button`, and icons from other components within the project.
- Defines interfaces for the component props and state management.
- Utilizes Day.js for managing dates and times.
- Constructs the bottom sheet with a handle, which can be closed or navigated through different steps (`activeStep`).
- Handles user interaction by defining functions like `handleNextStep`, `handlePrevStep`, and `handleClose`.
- Uses several utility functions from `~/utils` and `hooks` from `~/hooks` for various operations like prompt creation.
- Renders different steps/components inside the bottom sheet depending on the active step (`CategorySelectionStep`, `PromptDetailsStep`, and `TimePicker`).
- Contains logic for creating a prompt when the user fills in the necessary information and hits the "Continue" or "Create" button.

### Detailed Workflow:

- The component starts with an initial active step (`activeStep`).
- It provides category selection, prompt detail configuration, and time/frequency setting through different steps within the UI.
- The bottom sheet allows for progressing steps, going back, or closing the sheet entirely using the navigation button handlers defined.
- When all steps are completed and the process is successful, it leads to a success state `setSuccess(true)`, which displays a success message.
- It maintains local state for all input values, including the prompt text, category, response type, custom options, and time configuration.
- `createPrompt` is called to send the user's input to the server asynchronously, invoking a mutation (`mutateAsync`) from the `useCreatePrompt` hook.
- The component renders differently based on the state of success and the active step, showing different content on the bottom sheet to guide users through the process.

### Usage:

`CreatePromptSheet` is most likely used within the 'Prompts' feature of an application to allow users to add new prompts with a step-by-step walkthrough. The bottom sheet approach makes it mobile-friendly and user-centric, offering a smooth navigation experience for forming prompts with customized settings.

It's worth noting that this component integrates several hooks and external libraries (`@gorhom/bottom-sheet`, `dayjs`, `react-native-gesture-handler`), indicating a rich interactive experience tailored for mobile devices.
