The `src/components/option/option.stories.tsx` file contains the story definitions for the `Option` component used with Storybook, which is a tool for UI development and testing.

### Content of `src/components/option/option.stories.tsx`:

```tsx
import type { Meta, StoryObj } from "@storybook/react-native";
import { View } from "react-native";

import { Option, OptionProps } from "./option";

const meta: Meta<OptionProps> = {
  title: "ui/Option",
  component: Option,
};

export default meta;

type Story = StoryObj<OptionProps>;

export const Primary: Story = {
  args: {
    text: "Health and fitness",
  },
  render: (props) => (
    <View className="flex h-full p-4 bg-dark">
      <Option {...props} />
    </View>
  ),
};
```

### Explanation:

- **Storybook Meta Configuration:**
  - `Meta` is a TypeScript type imported from `@storybook/react-native` that defines the metadata for a set of stories (UI component examples).
  - The `meta` object sets the `title` to `"ui/Option"` which categorizes this story under the `ui` group in the Storybook navigation and gives it the name `Option`.
  - The `component` key links to the actual `Option` component, thus providing the reference needed for Storybook.

- **Default Export:**
  - The `meta` configuration is exported as the default export of the module. This is required for Storybook to recognize and use the configuration.

- **Story Type:**
  - `Story` is a `StoryObj` type representing a single story for the component.
  - The `StoryObj` type is parameterized with `OptionProps`, indicating the expected props for the `Option` component.

- **Primary Story:**
  - `Primary` is an example story for the `Option` component.
  - It defines `args`, which are the initial props that the `Option` component will receive.
  - The `render` function returns the `Option` component wrapped within a `View` component with styling applied, demonstrating how to use the component within a larger layout.

### Usage:

The story file is part of the Storybook configuration for the `Option` component and outlines how the component should be rendered with different sets of props for UI development and testing within the Storybook environment. The primary story is essentially an example of how to use the `Option` component with the text "Health and fitness". When Storybook is running, developers can view and interact with this example in isolation, making it easier to develop and test UI components.
