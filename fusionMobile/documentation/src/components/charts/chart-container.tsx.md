# src/components/charts/chart-container.tsx

This TypeScript file defines a `ChartContainer` functional component used for rendering charts based on responses to prompts within a specified time frame.

## Content Breakdown:

1. **Imports:**
   - Essential hooks and components from React, and React Native.
   - `dayjs` for date handling.
   - Two chart components, `FusionBarChart` and `FusionLineChart`, used for different types of chart rendering.
   - Types and context from other modules.
   - Services and utilities for fetch operations, data handling, and insights tracking.
   
2. **Types and Interfaces:**
   - Defines the `ChartContainerProps` interface which specifies the types of props the `ChartContainer` can receive.
   
3. **Component Definition:**
   - Defines the `ChartContainer` functional component with functionalities to:
      - Fetch and filter prompt responses based on the time period.
      - Generate chart data and options.
      - Track events and insights.
      - Toggle visibility for additional notes.

4. **State and Context:**
   - Uses `useState` to manage chart data, notes, and a toggle state for additional notes display.
   - Uses `useContext` to access the user's account context.

5. **Effect Hooks:**
   - An `useEffect` hook fetches prompt responses and generates the chart data on component mount and when dependencies change.
   
6. **Data Handling:**
   - Filters responses based on the provided start date and time period.
   - Sorts, calculates averages, and groups data for rendering in different chart types.
   - Tracks events using insights and updates corresponding states for rendering.
   
7. **Rendering:**
   - Depending on the response type (`yesno`, `number`, `customOptions`, `text`), renders the appropriate chart or list.
   - Utilizes a `ProgressBar` from `react-native-paper` for visual representation of data.
   - Handles the display of additional notes related to responses.
   - Uses `Pressable` components to allow interactivity with the additional notes section.
   - Conditional rendering based on response type and the existence of data.
   
8. **Usage:**

The component is used to render a contextual chart generated from the data based on user interactions recorded as prompt responses. It is flexible enough to handle different types of data visualizations â€“ line charts for binary responses, and bar charts for numerical and custom option responses.

The component presents insightful and user-interactive components understanding the user's interactions over a period, giving significant insights and visual representation of data trends.

The various chart-rendering functionality is conditioned on the `responseType` prop to ascertain what chart type to render, making it versatile enough to cater to different data visualization needs.
