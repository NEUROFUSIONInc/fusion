The file `src/components/input/index.ts` is a re-export file that simplifies the import statements for consumers of the `input` component. It bundles the export from `./input` and allows other parts of the application to import the input component from a single entry point.

### Content of `src/components/input/index.ts`:
```typescript
export * from "./input";
```

### Explanation:
- `export *`: This syntax is used to re-export all exports from the specified module.
- `from "./input"`: This specifies the module to re-export from, which is the `input` module in the same directory as the `index.ts` file.

### Example Usage:
Instead of importing the `input` component directly from its file like this:
```javascript
import { Input } from '~/components/input/input';
```

You can import it using the simplified path provided by the `index.ts` file:
```javascript
import { Input } from '~/components/input';
```

This helps in reducing the complexity of import paths and makes it easier to manage and consume components across the application. If more components are added to the `input` directory in the future, they can be easily exported through the `index.ts` file, providing a scalable way to manage component exports.
