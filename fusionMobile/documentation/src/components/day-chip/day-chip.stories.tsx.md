The `DayChip` component's Storybook stories are defined in this file. It offers a visual test playground for the `DayChip` component with different states and props. Here's a breakdown of the content:

1. **Imports:**
   - `Meta` and `StoryObj` types from Storybook for React Native, used for defining metadata and story objects.
   - The `View` component from `react-native` for layout purposes.
   - The `DayChip` component and its props type (`DayChipProps`) from the local file.
   - A `DaysArray` type, which presumably defines an array of string literals representing days of the week, from a type definition file.

2. **Helper Function:**
   - `getDaysArray` is a utility function that returns an array of strings representing the days of the week.

3. **Storybook Metadata:**
   - The `meta` object contains metadata for the Storybook, including the title `ui/DayChip` and the component (`DayChip`) that the stories will represent.

4. **Story Definitions:**
   - Three story objects are defined: `Primary`, `Active`, and `DayChips`.
   - `Primary`: Represents a basic `DayChip` with the `day` prop set to "Monday".
   - `Active`: Represents a `DayChip` with the `day` prop set to "Tuesday" and `isChecked` prop set to `true`, indicating that this `DayChip` is in an active or selected state.
   - `DayChips`: A more complex story that renders a row of `DayChip` components for each day of the week. It determines the current day and sets the corresponding `DayChip` to active. It also includes a placeholder for the `handleValueChange` prop, which logs to the console when a `DayChip` is clicked.

5. **Usage:**
   - These stories are used for development and testing purposes within Storybook, providing an interactive environment to test and document the behavior and appearance of the `DayChip` component under various conditions.

⚠️ **Note:**
- The `DaysArray` type and `getDaysArray` helper function are assumed to be imported from a separate type definition file (`"~/@types"`).
- The `console.log` in the `DayChips` story serves as a placeholder for the `handleValueChange` callback and would likely be replaced by a more meaningful action in a real-world scenario.
- The `className` used in the `render` methods indicates the usage of a utility-first CSS framework (such as Tailwind CSS) for styling, suggesting the project may have a setup to support such a framework in a React Native environment.
