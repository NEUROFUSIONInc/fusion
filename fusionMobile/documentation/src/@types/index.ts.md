# src/@types/index.ts

This TypeScript file contains definitions for various types and interfaces that are likely used for managing user prompts and their responses within the application.

## Contents

- `PromptResponseType` - A union type defining possible response types for a prompt (e.g., text, yes/no, number, or custom options).
- `Prompt` - An interface describing the structure for a prompt, including its UUID, text, response type, notification configuration, and additional metadata.
- `PromptAdditionalMeta` - A type for additional metadata associated with a prompt, which can include a category, notification status, and custom options.
- `CreatePrompt` - A type derived from the `Prompt` interface with some differences in which properties are optional, mainly for creating new prompts.
- `Days` - A union type defining the days of the week.
- `NotificationConfigDays` - A type defining a record where each day of the week is mapped to a boolean indicating if a notification should be issued on that day.
- `PromptNotificationResponse` - An interface representing a user's response to a prompt notification, including timestamps and the prompt's UUID.
- `PromptResponse` - An interface nearly identical to `PromptNotificationResponse`, potentially used for responses not initiated by notifications.
- `PromptResponseAdditionalMeta` - An interface for additional metadata associated with a prompt response, such as notes.
- `PromptResponseWithEvent` - An interface extending `PromptResponse` with an additional `event` property containing more details such as name and description.
- `Optional` - A utility type for making specific properties of a type optional.
- `UserAccount` - An interface describing the structure of a user account, including public/private keys and preferences.
- `UserPreferences` - An interface representing user preferences within the application.

## Usage

These types and interfaces are likely used throughout the application to maintain strong typing for components that deal with user prompts, responses, notifications, user accounts, and preferences. Ensuring these types match the expected data structure can help developers prevent bugs and streamline features like prompt creation, response handling, and user account management.

## Considerations

- Typing is very detailed, especially for interfaces that represent user responses, suggesting the application handles user interactions precisely and tracks them over time.
- The use of utility types like `Optional` adds flexibility for reuse, allowing for subsets of a type to be required while others are optional.
- User preferences included in `UserAccount` suggest customization capabilities for the application, indicating attention to user experience.
