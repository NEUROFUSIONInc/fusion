# ESLint Configuration

Welcome to the sacred realm of clean and consistent code. The `.eslintrc.js` is the grand oracle that high-priests of JavaScript and priests-in-training consult in order to make sure their code aligns with the scriptures of best practices. It lays down the laws that shall be followed religiously or face the purgatory of pull request comments. Let's dive deeper and ensure that every dev who wanders in this land knows how to appease the linting gods.

## Configuration Overview

This ESLint configuration is a fantastic concoction of various standards designed to keep your React Native and TypeScript code looking sharp and error-free – a bit like a suit for your code, but without the inconvenience of taking it to the dry cleaners.

Here's what the divine scripture includes:

- **Universe**: A pair of extendable configurations for native development and TypeScript analysis. It's like the guardian angels for your React Native app.

- **@tanstack/eslint-plugin-query**: Rules for those who dare to query with the grace of @tanstack. A blessing for keeping those queries in check.

- **Prettier**: This one ensures that even if your code does what it's supposed to, it also looks pretty doing it. Because, you know, appearances are everything (or so they say).

- **Plugins**: Our holy trinity of plugins – TypeScript support, a crusade against unused imports, and reinforcements from @tanstack/query.

- **Ignored Patterns**: "ios" and "android" folders are the proverbial Garden of Eden, free from the original sin of linting.

## Overrides and Rules

The overrides section casts a mighty spell over different file types in your codebase. It’s like the ESLint hammer that Thor wishes he had when a nasty unused variable appears in his JavaScript.

- Applies to `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.d.ts`, `.js`, and `.jsx` files, but not to your storybook stories. They are the bards of the codebase, and bards always get a pass.

- The `prettier/prettier` rule is turned off because sometimes not even Prettier can handle the beauty of your code.

- Dead imports must face the trial by fire with `unused-imports/no-unused-imports`.

- Those venturing to use `@tanstack/query` must master the arts of `exhaustive-deps` and `prefer-query-object-syntax`.

The `import/order` rule is like a Marie Kondo for your imports, ensuring everything sparks joy, in ascending order, with beautiful new lines separating the groups.

Unused vars are given a stern warning unless they start with an underscore, because sometimes a dash of mystery is all you need (`_mysteriousVar`).

Feel free to dive into each rule and tweak the scrolls as you see fit, but remember – with great configuration power comes great responsibility.

## How to Use this Configuration

Simply having this file in your project will ensure that ESLint picks up these rules when running its linting process. Whether you're proudly linting your code manually like a knight polishing armor or setting up a pre-commit hook to do it automatically like a savvy mage casting a spell, you're now equipped to maintain a codebase worth telling tales about.

May your code be as error-free as the humor in this document is cringe-free (a lofty goal, indeed).

Happy linting!
