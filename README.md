# Fusion

What do we find when we stop treating our usage data across apps as a by-product but as signals that we could use to understand ourselves better?

[Fusion](https://usefusion.app) allows you to record brain activity and correlate with other health & behaviour data like - interests, productivity data.

[](./overview.png)

## core data integrations

- brain activity (neurosity)
- productivity / actions on device - (magicflow, activitywatch)
- health (directly from Apple Health / Google Fit)

## Data Storage

Folder structure for uploaded data in Blob storage is in this format

`<userid>/YYYY/MM/DD/<data-type>/<data-type_unixtimestamp.json>`

Tags are stored in the storage for search. Tags used,

- userGuid
- dataName
- provider
- unixTimestamp

## Schemas

### Events

Events are used to tag recordings. You can have multiple events within a time range

- event must have 'startTimestamp' & 'event' obj
- if 'endTimestamp' is ommited, it is assumed you're just logging point in time (single action e.g drink coffee)
- 'eventValue' will be very useful for self sampling

```json
{
    startTimestamp
    endTimestamp
    name
    description
    value
}
```

## Visualizations

Goal build the best intuitive visualization

- allow to see visualization side by side
