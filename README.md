We need an open platform for self experimentation that is secure, easy to use and doesn't sacrifice user privacy. We've built:

- A mobile application [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/ca/app/usefusion/id6445860500?platform=iphone), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.neurofusion.fusion&pli=1) that helps you manage & improve your wellbeing with personalized prompts and AI coaching.
- A [web platform](https://usefusion.app/playground) for conducting and participating in distributed neurotechnology & behavior research.

All of this is to get us closer of our vision for a future where we live our days with more agency, awareness and less guesswork.
