# Fusion by NEUROFUSION Research Inc.

We need an open platform for self experimentation that is secure, easy to use and doesn't sacrifice user privacy. We've built:

- A mobile application that helps you manage & improve your wellbeing with personalized prompts and AI coaching.
- A web platform for conducting and participating in distributed neurotechnology & behavior research.

All of this is to get us closer of our vision for a future where we live our days with more agency, awareness and less guesswork.
