In navigating our day to day activities, sleep often takes a backseat in our priorities. Yet, quality sleep is important for our overall health and well-being. Issues like burnout, high stress, bad mood, and headaches often stem from poor sleep.

Understanding your sleep patterns can guide you in making healthier choices. By tracking your sleep, you can pinpoint areas for improvement and get better rest.

Wearable devices offer sleep tracking, but not everyone has access. Apple provides a built-in solution through the Health app on your iPhone. This guide will show you how to set up and use sleep tracking on your iPhone without extra gadgets.
