Still buzzing from Brain Hack in Toronto ðŸ§  where we shared our mission to accelerate open experimentation in brain and behavior research and ran a community brain recording pilot using NeuroFusion Explorer!

In 48 hours, we collected 25 brain recording sessions from 18 participants - one highlight for me was seeing people's eyes light up when they saw their brainwaves in real time. The process was simple yet fascinating; A person is asked to close and open their eyes, while wearing a mobile EEG headset. We analyzed their brain activity with a focus on their alpha (7-13Hz) power which is a measure of attention. We also collected self reports of coffee, energy and stress levels through the day.

## What Did We Find?

We found that alpha power when the eyes are closed is more than when the eyes are open. Although the analysis was not conclusive and multiple factors influence daily, this variation could be influenced by different factors, which opens up exciting avenues for further research.

## Experience of Participants

The participants' reactions were priceless. Many were amazed to see their brainwaves in real-time, and the simplicity of the process made it accessible to everyone.
This positive feedback has motivated us to expand our research and involve more people in our studies.

## What Are We Doing Next?

Weâ€™re excited to continue community driven experimentation with researchers with our Neurofusion Explorer Research Fellowship in 2025. We want to increase the rate of experimentation for researchers and institutions who are developing biomarkers for mental health using mobile wearables, cognitive assessments & self-reports.
