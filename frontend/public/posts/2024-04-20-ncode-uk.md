This April, we joined the [N-CODE study group](https://www.n-code.org/activity/n-code-stakeholder-led-study-group-april-2024/) hosted in Telford, UK. NCODE brings together clinicians and researchers in neurotechnology to co-create solutions for unmet needs that require the development of innovative neurotechnologies to shift the emphasis of diagnosis and management of various neurological conditions from the hospital into the community.

Our group is developing a _computerized cognitive assessment tool to detect Preclinical Alzheimer’s Disease_. What was most exciting for me is how easily we could port parts of NeuroFusion's open source code to host a prototype of the experience. Looking forward to deploying it and improving patient outcomes! 🧠

Here's a summary of our report from the event - [Using technology to improve the diagnostic accuracy of cognitive assessments for preclinical Alzheimer’s disease](https://www.n-code.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/using-technology-to-improve-the-diagnostic-accuracy-of-cognitive-assessments-for-preclinical-alzheimers-disease.pdf)
