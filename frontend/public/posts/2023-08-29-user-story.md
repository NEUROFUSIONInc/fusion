Navigating the complexities of celiac disease - a reaction to eating gluten - and an unpredictable immune system has been my journey for years. Due to my genetic makeup, my health struggles are complicated which means my symptoms are in subtle hints rather than glaring signals. It took almost two decades and consistent talks with my doctor to find some clarity.

The uncertainty of my health hangs over me as I make everyday choices. Will certain foods trigger issues? Could disrupted sleep or stress cause setbacks? And if things do go wrong, can I trace it back to the root cause and figure out why?

In my quest for answers, I had explored various options from time trackers, health apps, and journals. Unfortunately, these solutions either left questions unanswered or demanded more time than I could spare.

Then came Fusion…

Fusion seamlessly gathers data from various sources—personalized prompts, wearables, and apps—bringing them together in a user-friendly interface. But it's not just about collecting data; it's about finding patterns that impact how I live my days.

Fusion's gentle prompts help me see these patterns in my daily life, focusing on what's important to me. What's even more remarkable is that it's quick; I don't have to spend a lot of time to get useful insights.

I concentrated on prompts related to autoimmunity and connected matters. I chose the following prompts:

The results from Fusion's analysis were enlightening. The standout discovery? A direct link between my mental state and my diet.

At first, I dismissed it because I thought this was something everyone knows. But when I looked closer, I found something surprising. When I ate off my normal diet, I actually felt more energized—something I didn't expect. After thinking about it, I realized that on days when I was more social and active, I tended to eat less healthy. So, it was actually the other way around! With time, this insight became clearer.

> Recognizing this pattern where high energy led to eating less healthy helped me take control and avoid negative effects.

Fusion has already changed things for me in just a few weeks. It's shown me a way to understand health issues without doubting everything. With Fusion's help, I'm excited to see others find their own path to wellness.
