Maintaining a lifestyle that contributes to your longevity can be difficult. We sometimes discount the amount of work required to see progress which eventually leads to dropping the goals and the personalized prompts we optimistically set.

We designed **Quests**, to help you track activities, share results with others, and engage deeply with people that matter to you. In this article, we'll explore what Quests are, how they work, and how you can get started.

## What are Quests?

Quests allow you track various activities, share your progress, and connect with others through shared experiences with prompts. With quests, you can:

- share your health changes
- respond to prompts with your community to keep track of goals.

At its core quests are ways to deploy tools for behavioral and health research. With this, researchers can design prompts, deploy them, and analyze changes in participants' behaviors and health metrics, with informed consent.

## Why Use Quests?

We believe in the power of community, and quests provide a platform to connect with your friends, family, or even a supportive virtual community, while tracking your activities and achieving your well-being goals together.

- Share your health changes with others and see how you compare with the group.
- Behavioral Insights (For Researchers): Design custom quests with specific prompts to study targeted behaviors on trends and patterns without any geographical limits.
- Increased Motivation: Tracking progress alongside others will keep you accountable and motivated.
- Create Connections: Share your experiences with people that matter to you, motivate each other, and celebrate milestones together.
