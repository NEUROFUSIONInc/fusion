      "The 'Eyes Closed/Eyes Open' task is a common neurofeedback protocol used to measure brain activity during periods of rest and activity. During the task, the participant is instructed to close their eyes for a period of time, followed by opening their eyes for a period of time. This cycle is repeated several times, and the brain activity is measured using EEG sensors. The task is often used to measure changes in brain activity associated with attention, relaxation, and other cognitive processes.",
