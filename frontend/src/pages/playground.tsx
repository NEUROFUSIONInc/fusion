        "The 'Eyes Closed/Eyes Open' task is a common neurofeedback protocol used to measure brain activity during periods of rest and activity. During the task, the participant is instructed to close their eyes for a period of time, followed by opening their eyes for a period of time. This cycle is repeated several times, and the brain activity is measured using EEG sensors. The task is often used to measure changes in brain activity associated with attention, relaxation, and other cognitive processes.",

This wave is like a signal your brain sends when it recognizes a change in the pattern of sounds. It usually occurs around 300 milliseconds after your brain registers the oddball sound. Start the experiment to see how your brain responds!",

It is often used in clinical and experimental settings to measure selective attention and cognitive control. The task involves naming the color of a word, while ignoring the semantic meaning of the word. For example, the word 'red' might be written in blue ink. The task is often used to measure changes in brain activity associated with attention, relaxation, and other cognitive processes.",
