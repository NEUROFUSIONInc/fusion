- spectrogram - use these together with power to indentify times of interest.

tagging outcomes

- when I'm changing context from one activity to the other

questions:

- what's a good statistical correlation I can use for this

  - bin the powerByBand values to 'x' seconds averages
  - think about meaning (reference stats material)

- [] properly design the analysis view based on available data streams

Observations:

- using screenshots from device usage over time, also providers deeper context
