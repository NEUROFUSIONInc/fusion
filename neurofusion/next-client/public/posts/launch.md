Over the weekend, we released the Fusion app on the iOS app store! Pretty exciting right?

For those who are hearing about us for the first time, you might we wondering, “Who is Fusion?” or better yet “What is Fusion?”

Fusion is an app that helps you manage & improve your health, productivity, and well-being over time.

How? You may ask? - Unlike any other app, Fusion provides you with the tools to connect the dots between your actions and your overall well-being. We understand that life can get overwhelming, and it's easy to lose sight of how our daily choices impact our health, well-being and productivity. That's where Fusion comes in, we provide you with features that help you manage & improve aspects of your life.

## What You Can Do with Fusion

With the current version of our app, you can:

- **Create Personalized Prompts:** Add your prompts to align with your goals and needs. These prompts serve as gentle nudges to keep you on track or checkin with yourself.

- **Get Real-Time Insights:** From your prompts and responses, you can get insights on your behavior and wellbeing.

- **Health Monitoring:** You can monitor your health activities such as how many steps you’ve taken. (little secret: We are introducing more health features soon).

- **Collaborate with your Health Professionals:** You can export your responses and insights to your health professionals all in the comfort of your home.
