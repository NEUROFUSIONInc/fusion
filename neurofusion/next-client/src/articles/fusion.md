Since our launch, Fusion has helped you manage and improve your productivity, health and wellbeing. In the past, we took your responses and showed you how they changed over time using visuals. Now, with Fusion Copilot, you receive summaries and recommendations to act on based on your personalized context.

Feeling stressed or overwhelmed? Not sleeping well? Struggling to maintain a healthy work-life balance? With Fusion Copilot, you don't have to navigate these challenges alone. Whether you need help managing your time better, finding ways to reduce stress, or improving your sleep patterns, our Fusion Copilot provides you personalized recommendations to address these issues.

You can think of it as having an assistant helping you towards your goals of achieving productivity, health, and overall well-being.

## Enabling Fusion Copilot

To get started, simply enable the feature in your Fusion app settings (top right corner) or directly from the onboarding. When enabled, your prompts & responses will be sent to Fusion servers to personalize the recommendations specifically for you. We never store this information on our servers. Learn more about how we process data.

## Log Your Responses & Receive Tailored Recommendations

Once enabled, Fusion Copilot brings you recommendations based on insights gathered from your responses on the Fusion app. Through careful analysis of your responses and patterns, Fusion Copilot curates actionable practical recommendations for you to implement in various aspects of your life.

## Is Fusion Copilot a Premium Offer ?

Fusion Copilot marks the beginning of our premium offerings. You’ll always be able to create & respond to prompts for free. Fusion premium subscription will be $9.99/month. In future versions of Fusion, you’ll be able to:

- Edit previous responses
- Share custom reports
- Pair Fusion with your sleep, activity trackers, music listening history & screen time.

## We want your Feedback

While we're excited about this, it’s just the beginning! We’d love your feedback on how using Fusion is for you. Please share your suggestions in the app and we’ll get back to you shortly.
