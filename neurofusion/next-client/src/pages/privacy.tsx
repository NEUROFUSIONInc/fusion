          <h2>II. HOW WE USE AND SHARE INFORMATION</h2>
          <h3>Personal Information:</h3>
          <p>
            Except as otherwise stated in this Privacy Policy, we do not sell, trade, rent or otherwise share for
            marketing purposes your Personal Information with third parties without your consent. We do share Personal
            Information with vendors who are performing services for the Company, such as the servers for our email
            communications who are provided access to user’s email address for purposes of sending emails from us. Those
            vendors use your Personal Information only at our direction and in accordance with our Privacy Policy. In
            general, the Personal Information you provide to us is used to help us communicate with you. For example, we
            use Personal Information to contact users in response to questions, solicit feedback from users, provide
            technical support, and inform users about promotional offers. We may share Personal Information with outside
            parties if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation or disclosure of the information is
            reasonably necessary to meet any applicable legal process or enforceable governmental request; to enforce
            applicable Terms of Service, including investigation of potential violations; address fraud, security or
            technical concerns; or to protect against harm to the rights, property, or safety of our users or the public
            as required or permitted by law. Non-Personal Information In general, we use Non-Personal Information to
            help us improve the Service and customize the user experience. We also aggregate Non-Personal Information in
            order to track trends and analyze use patterns on the Site. This Privacy Policy does not limit in any way
            our use or disclosure of Non-Personal Information, we will only share information with third parties per
            your request. An example of this is should you choose to participate in a study via the platform, the
            organizer will request for you to share your data and we will facilitate the sharing between you and them.
            In the event we undergo a business transaction such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of
            all or a portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred. You
            acknowledge and consent that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy, and that any
            acquirer of our assets may continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy
            Policy. If our information practices change at any time in the future, we will post the policy changes to
            the Site so that you may opt out of the new information practices. We suggest that you check the Site
            periodically if you are concerned about how your information is used.

            is protected by your private key and we urge you to take steps to keep your personal information safe by not
            disclosing it. We further protect your information from potential security breaches by implementing certain
            technological security measures including encryption, firewalls and secure socket layer technology. As your
            information such as prompt text & responses are stored only on your device, an attacker will need to gain
            physical access to it to see your data. By using our Service, you acknowledge that you understand and agree
            to assume these risks.
          </p>

            promotional communication to a user, the user can opt out of further promotional communications by following
            the unsubscribe instructions provided in each promotional e-mail. You can also indicate that you do not wish
            to receive marketing communications from us in the settings section of the Site. Please note that
            notwithstanding the promotional preferences you indicate by either unsubscribing or opting out in the
            settings page of the Site, we may continue to send you administrative emails including, for example,
            periodic updates to our Privacy Policy.
